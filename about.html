                    <p>Like you, like all of us, Garrett Borns craves most what he cannot have. Anticipation, fantasy, longing—in
                        some ways, these emotions of desire are more powerful than any trophy. But it’s not like we have
                        a choice in the matter; love, as it’s been said, is all chemistry. In fact, it’s mostly a tiny chemical
                        messenger called dopamine that pulls our heartstrings and drives our acts of romance. And so that’s
                        just what the rising maestro BØRNS titled his debut full-length album of majestic, lovelorn anthems.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Dopamine is released when you are longing for something, the desire of a reward—it's the fantasy in
                        your mind,” says BØRNS. “The old ‘you want most what you can’t have’ expression. A lot of the songs
                        on the album are about wanting her but not being able to have her: ‘come back to me’ or ‘I wish I
                        had you’ songs. All the songs are inspired by a chemical connection to a lover, so dopamine is the
                        all-encompassing theme.”</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-12">
                    <p>BØRNS, a Michigan native who spent time in New York before landing in his new home of Los Angeles, is
                        a preternatural talent. He understands instinctively how to connect the intricacies of a melody to
                        the sensual receptors in the human ear, and how to conjure up a song from its building blocks to
                        reach the heavens. Working with the producer Tommy English, in 2014 BØRNS released the Candy EP,
                        a shot of sunny, sweet, sweeping adrenaline to the pop music landscape that put “10,000 Emerald Pools”
                        (produced by Kennedy) and “Electric Love” on playlists across the world. The latter even famously
                        earned a fan in Taylor Swift, who tweeted about the song’s immediate gravity to her millions of followers.
                        Recognizing something special, the Borns-English pair quickly began work on an album, writing and
                        recording in between the steadily growing live shows, and with the stage in mind. Enamored of and
                        inspired by his new home on the west coast, BØRNS injected much of that sunshine vibe into the new
                        music.

                    <p>While recording Dopamine, BØRNS was drawn to a stack of vintage Playboymagazines lying around the studio,
                        and he became captivated by the classiness and seductive, suggestive advertisements and editorial
                        messages from that bygone era. And as the son of an advertising firm owner, BØRNS acknowledges that
                        the ability to connect a message simply and directly to an audience has been with him his entire
                        life, which comes through in his lyrics.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I’m inspired by the pairing of words and phrases together to be clear, concise, and simplified,” says
                        BØRNS. “Those ’60s and ’70s era Playboys, the way they’re put together with film photography, the
                        articles, the way they advertise products—they know how to explain it to you situationally. ‘You’re
                        lounging on your balcony as the sun is slowly setting, drinking a Mai Tai, and there she is…’ Everything
                        is very sensual and clever. Flipping through those influenced the mood of a few songs on the record.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-12">
                    <p>One such number is Dopamine’s “Holy Ghost,” with its twinkling keyboards, Zapp-funk pops, synthesized
                        drum rolls, and precise, macho riffs. In a confident, yearning falsetto, BØRNS sings: “Let me satisfy
                        your soul/I’m not a saint but do I have to be/Baby, you’re my holy ghost/and I need you close, come
                        back to me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“American Money,” a song for which BØRNS had written the verses on acoustic guitar before bringing it
                        into a session with English, is a twist on a common thematic standard in modern music: cash. “The
                        chorus came out of ‘The paradise in your eyes, green like American money’; like saying, ‘Darling,
                        you look like a million bucks,’ it’s the green in her eyes, the greener pasture, she is the promised
                        land. And when Tommy put this darker, down-tempo hip-hop beat behind it, the song took this moodier
                        route.”</p>
